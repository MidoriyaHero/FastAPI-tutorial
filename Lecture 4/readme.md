# Lecture 4: Request Body
READ THIS [LINK](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/) to learn about the basic concept

### Here I will give you somethings that I noted:

```
A request body is data sent by the client to your API. A response body is the data your API sends to the client.
```

```
You can test by sending a request body from /docs (http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
```
